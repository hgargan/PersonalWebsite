    <h2>The Metaphysics of Beard-Having</h2><hr>
<p><strong>If you know me,</strong> you know I like to talk about my beard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided to dial it back a bit,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll offer to anyone who asks how I&rsquo;m doing. &ldquo;I missed seeing the outline of my jaw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My beard waxes and wanes like the moon, with more or less the same frequency. It adds and subtracts years and gruffness from my countenance. I can go from young and innocent on Monday to suave and bristly by Thursday to wild and rugged three or four weeks later. And then I start over.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re all searching for the look that most accurately (or flatteringly) represents to the outside world who we feel ourselves to be. That relationship is reciprocal, too. One of my good friends recently got a fantastic haircut. It is now clear she should have always had this haircut. The two were made for each other, and it shows.&#160;She deserves her haircut, but her haircut has in turn given her the confidence to be the person you&rsquo;d expect to see beneath it.</p>

<p>Similarly, I&rsquo;ve begun to associate different stages and styles of beard growth with my life&rsquo;s changing seasons. The last time I grew it out, I was an exchange student in Paris and absolutely fed up with the idea of &ldquo;trying,&rdquo; which I realize now with some horror clearly distinguishes me, in that period of my life, as an asshole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There really aren&rsquo;t any consequences here,&rdquo; I remember explaining. &ldquo;After all, who am I trying to impress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what a big beard says: Do I look like I give a fuck?</p>

<p>When I shave after a long period of beard-having, the world softens. My overlarge eyes dominate my face and give me a more earnest look, and I see the youthful vulnerability of my beardlessness reflected in the world around me.</p>

<p>But my inner identity crisis is then complicated by the wide variety of opinions with which stakeholders provide me. Beardless men wistfully urge me to grow the beard they never could. My father, like many others, prefers a closely-trimmed beard (the intermediate stage, about a week&rsquo;s worth of growth, is objectively when I look the best). My crunchier friends promote the full mountain-man look. Others can&rsquo;t abide facial hair at all, on principle.</p>

<p>Thus, in addition to what the beard confers upon my appearance, the process of choosing whether to wear one says something about what and who I value.</p>

<p>Imagine if you could choose exactly what you looked like. Knowing you had that power, would you ever be able to pick one look at stick to it? I think I&rsquo;d be better off if I&rsquo;d been forced to accept my image, one way or the other. Instead, I&rsquo;m given the dangerous illusion of control, something I&rsquo;ve always desired and then misused. The beard, as it turns out, is a fairly benign manifestation of this tendency. Some people buy lots of clothes to satisfy the same itch. I trim my beard.</p>

<p>But more constructively, I've begun to see it as a reminder of life's dynamic Quality. That I can desire a beard of a certain length, desire it gone, and then re-desire that same beard a month later says a lot about how cosmically pathetic my desire for control can be. How could I possibly be in control of my destiny when I can&rsquo;t be sure whether the destiny I&rsquo;m aiming for will remain attractive by the time I&rsquo;m set to fulfill it?</p>

<p>My beard will continue to be the object of endless tinkering and experimentation, most of it harmless. But I hope that it also serves to remind me that even the best-laid plans &mdash; and most expertly groomed beards &mdash; will never last as such.</p>
