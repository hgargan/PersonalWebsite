            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>I grew up in Chapel Hill, N.C., so I was a townie before I was a UNC student. I recently graduated with degrees in multimedia journalism and global studies (with concentrations in international politics/Africa). It's a mouthful, I know.</p>
            <p>Right now I'm working at Newsday on Long Island as a Dow Jones News Fund editing intern, but before that I was opinion editor at The Daily Tar Heel, UNC's independent student newspaper. And before that? I was a sportswriter. I spent my sophomore year as assistant sports editor at the DTH, and I covered sports as a stringer for various local, regional and national publications throughout my college career.</p>
            <p>Since then, I've veered away from sports, at least professionally. My interests now tend toward politics and the problems of poverty, mental health, and social conflict in general. I also secretly aspire to be on the radio, but I'm not entirely sure how to get there. Let me know if you can help!</p>
